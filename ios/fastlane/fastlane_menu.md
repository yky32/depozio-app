## 🔑 Important Notes

1. **All commands should be run from the `ios` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   bundle exec fastlane [lane_name]
   ```

2. **Code Signing:** iOS builds require proper code signing setup in Xcode. Make sure your certificates and provisioning profiles are configured.

3. **Build Numbers:** Always increment build numbers before TestFlight/App Store uploads:
   ```bash
   bundle exec fastlane ios increment_build
   ```

4. **TestFlight Authentication:** The `upload_testflight` lane requires App Store Connect authentication. You may need to set up API keys or authenticate with your Apple ID.

5. **Export Methods:** Different export methods require different certificates:
   - `development` - Development certificate
   - `ad-hoc` - Distribution certificate with ad-hoc provisioning profile
   - `app-store` - Distribution certificate with App Store provisioning profile
   - `enterprise` - Enterprise distribution certificate
